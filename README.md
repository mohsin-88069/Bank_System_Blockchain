# Bank_System_Blockchain

## Idea

### To create a decentralised system of banking for fund raising, on Ethereum using blockchain technology.

## Working
Implement a decentralised application on Ethereum Network using blockchain technology deployed on test network rinkeby faucet. This will make the banking system totally decentralised for activities like fund raising. There will be a central smart contract which will take care of all the banking transactions. Anyone, who wants to raise the funds for his/her startup can start a campaign through the application. The contributors can donate the money to the smart contract that we will deploy.
